This is an android project I worked on a few years ago that utilized web services to connect an app to a drupal web site.  This particular website contained user provided content such as wallpapers and ringtones which were made available via this app.  At the time of development, Drupal 6 was the latest version of Drupal, so many of the methods used in this project would need to be updated to work with newer releases of Drupal.
